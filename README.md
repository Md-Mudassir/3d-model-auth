# 3d-model-auth
A robust tool for embedding and verifying digital signatures in 3D model files, designed to combat piracy and ensure authenticity. This project uses RSA cryptography to generate tamper-proof signatures and seamlessly integrates them into .obj files without altering the original file structure.
